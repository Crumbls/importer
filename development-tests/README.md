# Development Test Scripts

This directory contains development and debugging scripts used during the creation of the importer package. These are not part of the formal test suite.

## Scripts

- `test-csv-tsv-analysis.php` - CSV/TSV format analysis and testing
- `test-live-wordpress-analysis.php` - Live WordPress database analysis
- `test-migration.php` - Migration testing script
- `test-post-type-analyzer.php` - WordPress post type analysis

These scripts can be run directly with `php script-name.php` but are primarily for development purposes.
